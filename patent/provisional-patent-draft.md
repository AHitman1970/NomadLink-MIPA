NomadLink Modular Independent Power Architecture (MIPA)
Inventor: Aaron Dean Whitman


## Title
NomadLink Modular Independent Power Architecture (MIPA)


## Inventor
Aaron Dean Whitman


## Field of the Invention
The invention relates to renewable energy systems, specifically to **modular, zone-based architectures** for electrical power generation, storage, and distribution. It covers systems ranging from small-scale personal devices (bicycles, camping systems) to large-scale buildings (multi-tenant towers) with optional interconnection to traditional power grids.


## Background
Traditional renewable energy systems rely on centralized battery banks, complex wiring, and controllers that introduce significant weight, parasitic loads, and maintenance burdens. Existing architectures often require daily management, large fixed installations, and high idle losses. They lack flexibility for modular growth and individualized user control.


There is a need for a **lightweight, modular, scalable system** that:
- Eliminates heavy central battery banks.
- Allows each functional zone to be **self-contained** with its own renewable generation and storage.
- Operates independently by default, but can **optionally interconnect** without introducing parasitic drain.
- Grants **user-level control** through common wireless devices (phones, tablets) while maintaining local autonomy.
- Scales from personal transportation (bike) to habitation units (vans, apartments) to large buildings (skyscrapers).


## Summary of the Invention
NomadLink MIPA is an **open, modular power architecture** composed of self-contained energy “zones.” Each zone integrates renewable input(s), local storage, and direct-to-load distribution. Zones operate as islands by default, ensuring fault isolation and minimal parasitic draw. Interconnection between zones is **manual or policy-controlled**, accomplished via **isolated bidirectional couplers** that are normally de-energized. This prevents idle drain and enforces deliberate, opt-in energy sharing.


At larger scales (apartments, floors, towers), unit-level zones can be linked into cluster-grids and macro-grids through **dormant DC backbones** (e.g., 48 V or 380 V), which activate only when needed. This maintains independence at the lowest level while supporting cooperation at higher levels.


## Claims (Draft)
1. A modular independent power architecture comprising:
- a plurality of zones, each zone including at least one renewable source, a charge controller, an energy storage module, and local distribution;
- wherein each zone operates independently by default;
- and wherein zones may be selectively interconnected via isolated couplers that remain de-energized unless enabled.


2. The architecture of claim 1, wherein said renewable source is selected from: photovoltaic panels, kinetic generators, wind turbines, or regenerative braking systems.


3. The architecture of claim 1, wherein said storage comprises lithium-based battery modules (LFP, Li-ion, Na-ion) sized 10 Ah to multi-MWh.


4. The architecture of claim 1, wherein said local distribution is DC-first, providing 12–48 V DC and USB-C PD outputs, with AC inversion only when required.


5. The architecture of claim 1, wherein said isolated couplers are manually enabled, policy-governed, or user-controlled through a local application, and are otherwise off to prevent parasitic drain.


6. The architecture of claim 1, wherein said architecture scales from a single portable zone (bike or van) to multi-unit residential systems and high-rise buildings.


7. The architecture of claim 1, further comprising an optional intertie to a traditional grid or generator (“shore power”), controlled manually or by policy, with anti-islanding protection.


8. The architecture of claim 1, wherein each user or tenant maintains individual ownership and control of their zone’s energy management via personal wireless devices.


## Advantages
- **Lightweight & modular**: avoids massive centralized banks.
- **Resilient**: failure in one zone does not disable others.
- **Efficient**: near-zero idle losses.
- **Scalable**: works for survival gear, vehicles, or skyscrapers.
- **User-controlled**: decentralized decision-making.

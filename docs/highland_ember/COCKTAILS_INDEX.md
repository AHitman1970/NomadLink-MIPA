## 1) Core Concept
Highland Ember cocktails are designed as **ritual drinks**, not just beverages.  
Each recipe ties into fire, hearth, and cultural lineage.  
The cocktails extend the Highland Ember brand into craft hospitality.

## 3) Lifestyle Pairings
- Each Ember cocktail can be paired with a **Me-Roll** (see `ME_ROLLS.md`).  
- Creates a signature ritual: *Sip the Ember, spark the Me-Roll.*

## 4) Brand Integration
- Cocktail anchors link Highland Ember’s **craft culture** to Exoform + NomadLink technical anchors.  
- Serve as human-facing entry points for the larger mythos.

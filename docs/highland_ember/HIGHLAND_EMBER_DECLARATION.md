# Highland Ember — Declaration Document
**Author:** Aaron Dean Whitman  
**Project Link:** NomadLink-MIPA / Exoform  
**Timestamp:** 2025  

---

## 1. Purpose
Highland Ember is the **cultural, symbolic, and narrative** framework that complements the Exoform project.  
Where Exoform builds a powered exosuit, Highland Ember preserves the **mythos, legacy, and creative identity** tied to the technology.

---

## 2. Principles
1. **Narrative Anchoring:** Every technical advance in Exoform has a story counterpart in Highland Ember.  
2. **Cultural Continuity:** The Ember brand evolves across cultures, generations, and epochs (past, present, future).  
3. **Open Source Identity:** Just as code and hardware are open-source, so too are the myths and creative works.  
4. **Linked Authorship:** Both projects are signed under one name — Aaron Dean Whitman.  

---

## 3. Scope
- Exoform is the **technical suit**.  
- Highland Ember is the **flame, hearth, and mythos** that surrounds it.  
- Both projects live in the same repository to show inseparability of creation and creator.

Project: NomadLink-MIPA (Modular Independent Power Architecture)

## 1) Definition
**NomadLink-MIPA** = Modular Independent Power Architecture.  
It is a survival-first, scalable system for providing modular power, control, and networking.  
- Works from the smallest node (an LED light) to the largest scale (a skyscraper).  
- Designed to be self-contained, resilient, and independent of centralized grids.  
- Built around the philosophy: **if one module fails, the system continues**.

---

## 2) Core Principles
- **Modularity:** every node is replaceable, upgradable, or bypassed.  
- **Survival:** system can operate off-grid with available energy inputs (solar, kinetic, stored).  
- **Scalability:** no upper bound — one architecture scales from campfire survival to city power.  
- **Connectivity:** integrates with any network (wired, wireless, overlay, decentralized).  
- **Openness:** designed as open hardware/software, community-extendable.  

---

## 3) System Layers
- **Power Layer:** modular power cells, buses, and safety cutoffs.  
- **Control Layer:** microcontrollers, SBCs, and local logic nodes.  
- **Network Layer:** NomadLink-DataBridge, Yggdrasil overlay, decentralized links.  
- **Application Layer:** anything connected — lights, servers, suits, cities.  

---

## 4) Survival Parameters
- Self-starting on minimal input (hand crank, solar strip, kinetic).  
- Each node must be serviceable in the field with basic tools.  
- Reserve capacity per node to allow graceful fallback.  
- Nodes must communicate status upstream (power available, faults).  

---

## 5) Expansion Examples
- **Micro:** LED survival lamp powered by a palm-sized MIPA node.  
- **Meso:** Exoform suit modules (EM-Muscle, helmet, sensors).  
- **Macro:** DataBridge connectivity, multi-building microgrid.  
- **Mega:** Skyscraper or city-level independent power using chained nodes.

## 6) Licensing Anchor
- Released under an **open hardware/software license**.  
- Attribution is required: “NomadLink-MIPA (Whitman, 2025).”  
- Survival and constructive use intended; responsibility for applications rests with implementers.  

---

## 7) Roadmap Tie-Ins
- DataBridge = networking extension of MIPA.  
- EM-Muscle = power + actuation application of MIPA.  
- Exoform Suit = human augmentation application of MIPA.  
- Highland Ember = cultural/brand sibling that grounds MIPA in human story.

# NomadLink MIPA — Field Checklist
**Created by Aaron Dean Whitman**


## Commissioning a Zone
- [ ] Mount PV panel; ensure tilt/angle unobstructed.
- [ ] Connect PV to MPPT (correct polarity).
- [ ] Connect MPPT to battery (fuse ≤15 cm from + terminal).
- [ ] Confirm MPPT charge profile matches battery chemistry.
- [ ] Wire DC/DC converters and hubs; size fuses at 125% load.
- [ ] Verify idle current draw <10 mA when system off.
- [ ] Label all cables and fuses.


## Daily Operation
- [ ] Place PV in sun; avoid shading.
- [ ] Check battery SOC on BMS or LED meter.
- [ ] Confirm devices charge via USB-C PD.
- [ ] BLE devices remember last state without phone.


## Maintenance
- [ ] Inspect connectors/cables monthly for wear.
- [ ] Test fuse continuity with spares available.
- [ ] Rotate/swappable batteries periodically.
- [ ] Ventilate battery spaces (ambient cabin air).


## Troubleshooting Quick Ref
- **No charge**: Check PV → MPPT polarity, sun exposure.
- **Fast drain**: Verify idle draws, switch off inverters.
- **Device not charging**: Confirm PD negotiation, cable rating.
- **Overheating**: Ensure ventilation for fridge/compressor zones.


## Emergency
- [ ] Each zone has manual disconnect switch.
- [ ] Keep at least one foldable PV + 20Ah battery as emergency reserve.
- [ ] Life-safety loads (lights, alarms) on dedicated battery.

# Provisional Patent Draft â€” NomadLink Modular Independent Power Architecture
**Inventor:** Aaron Dean Whitman


## Claims (draft)
1. A modular, zone-based power architecture wherein each zone comprises:
- a renewable energy input (solar, wind, kinetic, or regenerative),
- a local energy storage unit,
- an independent control unit,
- optional tethering means to connect to other zones without parasitic idle losses.


2. The method of scaling from personal transport systems (e.g., bicycles) to large-scale structures (e.g., skyscrapers) while retaining modular independence at each level.


3. A control architecture wherein each user or tenant retains control of their zone through personal devices using wireless communication protocols, independent of centralized building management.


4. An optional building-scale DC backbone that remains dormant unless explicitly engaged, providing aggregated storage and optional intertie to external grids.


## Status
This draft serves to secure a priority date for the invention and will be followed by a formal utility patent filing.

# Architecture Overview — NomadLink MIPA


NomadLink MIPA provides a scalable renewable power system designed around independent zones that can optionally interconnect.


## Principles
- Zones function independently.
- Optional tethering for resilience.
- DC-first distribution.
- Minimal idle drain.
- Tenant-owned control.


## Scalability Examples
- **Bike Nano-Zone** — PV panel + small LFP + BLE lights.
- **Van Micro-Zones** — 100W PV + 10–50Ah LFP per zone.
- **Apartment Unit-Grid** — Balcony PV + 1–4kWh storage, DC-first distribution.
- **Floor Cluster-Grid** — Independent units, optional floor-level buffer.
- **Tower Macro-Grid** — BIPV curtain wall + rooftop PV, MWh storage, optional grid tie.
